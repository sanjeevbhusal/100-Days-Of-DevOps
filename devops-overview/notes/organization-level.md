## DevOps at the Organization level

<br>

The entire process of building a software is broken down into multiple steps.

1. The stakeholders first decide upon the feature that needs to be built.
2. Developers build the feature
3. The entire code is built into artifacts (containers, mobile apps, binary executable
4. Those artifacts are tested either with Automatic Testing or Manual Testing through QA engineers or both approach.
5. Once the artifact is sure to be error free, then a release version (1.4) is created and a release document is prepared illustrating all the changes in this artifact
6. The release is then distributed (mobile applications are published to app store, containers are deployed to servers and other files are hosted)
7. Now the application have to be monitored for any code errors or any scaling problems
8. Based upon monitoring metrics, new servers might be added or if there are any issues with the code, appropriate personals are notified.

Finally, the monitoring metrics and user feedback are incorporated into making a new planning phase and all the steps happens again.
