If a computer A wants to communicate with computer B, you will need a switch. You need to connect both computers to Switch. Switch then creates a network via which both computers can communicate with each other. For a computer to attach with Switch, it needs a network interface. This interface could be physical or virtual. 

 You can use the following command to view all the network interfaces in the machine. 

```shell
ip link
```
