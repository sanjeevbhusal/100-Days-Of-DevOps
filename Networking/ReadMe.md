## IP Address

If 2 devices wants to communicate with other, both will need some kind of identfier, which uniquely identifies them.

This is what a IP address does. IP stands for Internet Protocol. This means IP address falls under IP layer in OSI Model.

A computer gets an IP from the Internet Provider. If a device disconnects from Internet and connect again, the device will get a new IP address.
