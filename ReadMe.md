# Note

DevOps is a more theoretial as compared to programming. So, all these devops notes will just be a summary of my understanding of devops concepts.

I will include all the learning resources, code snippets and command whenever necessary.

<br>

# Directory Structure

All the root-level folders contain `ReadMe` file and `notes` folder.

notes directory contains multiple files. Each file is a detailed note on a particular topic.

ReadMe file arranges those files in a sequential manner.

It is advised to go through ReadMe instead of going through individual notes.
